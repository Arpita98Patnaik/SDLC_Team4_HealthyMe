## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Selection of common programming language
    * With the amount of varied expertise brought in by the team  setting on a common language was challenging. We finally settled on C programming.
2. Integration of developed modules
    * Integration of individual modules was challenging as each member had their own approach and comming up with a common structure based approach was both challenging and time consuming.
3. Testing of modules
    * Testing of each individual modules and also ensuring that each function adhered to the common structure format required re-work on everyone's part.
4. Setting up of Git workflows  
    * Setting up of individual workflows for the various batches and ensuring the required criteria was met required bug fixes and improvement on code quality.
