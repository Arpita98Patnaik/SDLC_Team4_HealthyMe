## Introduction
Physical fitness and health plays an important role in our day to day life. Regular exercise and physical activity in terms of sports, workouts and running promotes strong muscles and bones. It also improves respiratory, cardiovascular and over health. With the recent unprecedented times of the Covid-19 pandemic the need for home workouts and a manageable diet based on individual needs has become  one of the most common requirements to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Improving technology has also played a major role in our everyday lives with an increase in jobs that promote an increasingly sendentary lifestyle. All these factors have contributed to a decline in the over all health and lifestyle of people these days.
