## Introduction
Physical fitness and health plays an important role in our day to day life. Regular exercise and physical activity in terms of sports, workouts and running promotes strong muscles and bones.

## Research
### The idea behind *Healthy Me!*
With the advent of Fast-food chain restaurants there are unhealthy yet tasty fast food items that are available at cheaper prices and with the introduction of food delivery aggregators people are inclined to order out rather than maintain a balanced or healthy diet. Improving technology has also played a major role in our everyday lives with an increase in jobs that promote an increasingly sendentary lifestyle. All these factors have contributed to a decline in the over all health and lifestyle of people these days.

With the recent spread of awareness in terms of social media over the various health concerns with an increasingly inactive lifestyle and its drawbacks people have now realised the benifit of exercise and a balanced but yet do not find the time to join Gym memberships and also find these overly expesive. Thus the solution in this case comes in terms of home workouts and health trackers that would allow user's to monitor not just their physical activity but their calorie intake as well.

Healthy Me is an inexpensive and easy to use appliaction that can recommend a custom health plan consisting of both a balanced, healthy diet as well as a rigorous workout session based on the users:
* Height
* Weight
* Age
* Gender

This data is used to calculate the user's **BMI, BMR** index and these values would then be used to ensure that the best possible fitness regime is recommended. The user may also accurately track their calorie intake to ensure they stick to the set plan and also keep a track of their water intake and set personalised goal that meets their requirements and comfort. All this coupled with easy access anytime and anywhere makes Healthy Me a convincing application that would be of great to use to a large demographic of young users and working professionals.
